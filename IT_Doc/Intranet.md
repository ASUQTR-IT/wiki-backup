# Intranet

We have a new intranet to replace the Atlassian suite, this page presents all the new ASUQTR services

## 1 - The physical server 

Everything is running on the "Atlantic" server, graciously lent by the LSSI, at UQTR, at UQTR (2486, Léon-Provancher).

Specs :

- IBM System x3650 M4
- Two 12-core Intel Xeon E5-2600 (24 cores in total)
- 32GB DDR3 ECC RAM (Max is 768GB)
- Twelve 2.5 HDD, 5.4 TB total
- Two 750W power supply (Hydro Québec goes brrrrrrrrrr)

The OS is TODO and everything is running in Docker containers
