# Sous-Marin ASUQTR : II. How to Code with Python 3

Created by Gabriel Tremblay, last modified on Oct 26, 2020

*When you want to learn basic programming with Python 3 for ASUQTR submarine*

** [1\. Generic software concepts](#II.HowtoCodewithPython3-1.Genericsoftwareconcepts)
* [2\. Specific software concepts for ASUQTR](#II.HowtoCodewithPython3-2.SpecificsoftwareconceptsforASUQTR)
* [3\. Getting to know the Python 3 syntax](#II.HowtoCodewithPython3-3.GettingtoknowthePython3syntax)

  * [Related articles](#II.HowtoCodewithPython3-Relatedarticles)*

This is the **first tutorial** you should do to integrate the ASUQTR software team. It goes over the **Software Concepts** and then shows a **Python 3** tutorial using these concepts. The quickest way to get running as a software developper for ASUQTR is to <u>read about the concepts</u> and <u>understand the basics</u>. You do not need to be a master of them, but it is generally a bad idea to skip those readings, as they are the absolute basics.

# **1\. Generic software concepts**

Before even using python 3, the first concepts of software development one sould know to join the ASUQTR team are the following (click concepts for brief explanations) :

* [What is an IDE](https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-is-an-IDE-integrated-development-environment#:~:text=December%2010%2C%202015-,An%20integrated%20development%20environment%20(IDE)%20is%20a%20software%20application%20that,automation%20tools%20and%20a%20debugger.&text=Most%20IDEs%20contain%20a%20code,debugger%2C%20and%20build%20automation%20tools).
* [What is a variable](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp)
* [What is a function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)
* [What is an if statement](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp)
* [What is a while loop](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp)
* [What is a for loop](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp)

# **2. Specific software concepts for ASUQTR**

In ASUQTR, just like in most of modern software world, we use **Object Oriented Programming**. This comes with some new concept which are helpful and essential for big projects like the submarine. Here's what you want to know :

* [What is an object in programming](https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-object-in-programming#:~:text=The%20object%20is%20the%20thing,object%20is%20a%20specific%20thing.)
* [What is a class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming))
* [What is a method](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3786881/what-is-a-method-in-python)
* [What is an object attribute](https://medium.com/swlh/class-and-object-attributes-python-8191dcd1f4cf#:~:text=An%20instance%2Fobject%20attribute%20is,the%20__init__%20constructor.)

# **3. Getting to know the Python 3 syntax**

Now that you have a fair understanding of the basics, you can start to follow this python tutorial which is for absolute beginners. Feel free to skip the parts you already know.

The main idea is to focus on the**syntax of Python 3** to work with the concept we just talked about. Some python3 sppecific actions you should be able to do :

* Create, update and iterate through a **list**to use its stored values
* Create, update and iterate through a **dict**'s keys and values to use them

Please focus on the parts mentionned in sections **1\.**and **2\.**of this tutorial.
