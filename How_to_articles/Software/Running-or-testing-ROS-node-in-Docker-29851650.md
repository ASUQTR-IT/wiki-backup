# Sous-Marin ASUQTR : Running/testing ROS node in Docker

Created by Maxime Verreault, last modified by Gabriel Tremblay on Oct 30, 2020

When developing a ROS node, a real ROS environment is necessary to validate the behaviour of the code. For that, you either need to have ROS installated in a Linux environment or you can have a Docker container with ROS installed in it. Choosing the latter opens up a lot of opportunities for testing with a Continuous Integration software. We have Bamboo at our disposal, so this guide will help you to run/test your ROS node in a Docker container 1) manually and 2) automatically with Bamboo.

## Running the ROS node manually in a Docker container

|1|Install Docker|[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)|
|2|Pull the Docker image specifically made for our needs|```
docker pull trypinapple/asuqtr_ros
```|
|3|Instantiate a new Docker container from the image|```
docker run -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix/:/tmp/.X11-unix trypinapple/asuqtr_ros
```|
|4|Clone your repository into the correct folder|```
cd /home/root/catkin_ws/src && git clone https://YOUR.GIT.REPO.URL/repo.git
```|
|5|Execute the catkin\_make command|```
cd /home/root/catkin_make && catkin_make
```|
|6|Launch your ROS node|```
roslaunch your_package your_package.launch
```|
