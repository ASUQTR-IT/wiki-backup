# Sous-Marin ASUQTR : Associate a name to a USB device in Ubuntu

Created by Maxime Verreault, last modified on Mar 09, 2020

When implementing a node for a USB device, the name must be specified when opening the port. This name is something like "ttyUSB0" and is subject to change based on the order the USB devices were connected. There is a way to associate a name to a specific USB device with udev rules under Ubuntu. The following steps will guide you through the process.

## Step-by-step guide

1. Get the information about the device you're looking to associate a name to with this command :

```
udevadm info -a -p  $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/ttyUSB0)
```

   Where /dev/ttyUSB0 is modified with the current name designation for your device.
2. Edit /etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules to contain :

```
ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", SYMLINK+="my_uart"
```

Where idVendor, idProduct and the name you want to attribute to the device inserted in the command.
