## Introduction

Have guidelines on what the scrum master shall take responsibility for.

## Communications Procedure

* When a story was not completed during the sprint, always try to split it during the sprint slanning
* Make sure the backlogs are ready for the coming sprint planning
* Have a lot of communication with the product owner for filling the backlog
* Know the rythm/progress of every single dev in your team
* have an up-to-date mid-sprint and sprint calendar
* write in #everyone on discord a reminder of the date/time of the sprint (do the same for the mid-sprint)

## Tools and techniques

* retrospective of sprint every 4 weeks
* mi-sprint in the middle (second week)

<u>How to prepare the retrospective of sprint</u>

1. prepare retrospective on confluence (date, hour, names)
2. prépare new sprint

During the retrospective of sprint

1. burndown chart (good?, can be better?, not good?, etc.)
2. retrospective (on confluence)
3. close sprint
4. backlog (what tasks my dev want?)
5. start new sprint

During the mi-sprint

Scrum masters shall ask feedback to the devs at mi-sprint
